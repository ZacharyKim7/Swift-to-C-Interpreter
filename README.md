# Swift-to-C-Interpreter
A Swift to C interpreter developed as the primary project for CPTR 354 Compilers and Languages at Walla Walla University. Implemented the scanner using FLEX, the parser and grammar using BISON, and the abstract syntax tree in C.

Repository moved from University's privately hosted Gitlab server to here on Github for public access.
